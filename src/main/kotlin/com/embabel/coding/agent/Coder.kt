/**
 * Embabel coding agent.
 *
 * The Coder agent is responsible for modifying code in a software project based on user requests.
 * The agent flow is as follows:
 *
 * 1. loadExistingProject: Loads the project from the repository
 * 2. codeModificationRequestFromUserInput: Converts user input into a structured code modification request
 * 3. modifyCode: Makes the requested changes to the codebase
 * 4. build/buildWithCommand: Builds the project if needed (triggered by the BuildNeeded condition)
 * 5. fixBrokenBuild: If the build fails, attempts to fix the issues
 * 6. shareCodeModificationReport: Returns the final report of changes made
 *
 * The agent uses conditions to control the flow:
 * - BuildNeeded: Triggered after code modification to determine if a build is required
 * - BuildSucceeded/BuildFailed: Tracks build status
 * - BuildWasLastAction: Helps determine the next step in the flow
